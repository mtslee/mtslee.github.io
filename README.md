# Hi everyone!
My name is Matthew Lee and I want to thank you for taking the time to visit my data science portfolio. Please explore some of the projects I have done during my undergraduate career at the University of California, Davis. 


# About Me
I am currently a senior at the University of California, Davis with a double major in Applied Statistics and Economics. As an avid basketball fan, I have always been fascinated by numbers and statistics. This interest led me to pursue my major where I could learn more about how people incorporate data into decision making. When I graduate, I hope to continue my work in Data Science and Research and potentially work for the NBA.

## STA 141B - Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis
[USDA Fresh Foods](141b/assignment4+Matthew+Lee.html) 

This was an assignment for my data science course where I used the USDA API key to get the nutritional information for a list of common fruits and vegetables.

## STA 141A - Fundamentals of Statistical Data Science

[NHANES](141a/141a+hw+2.html) 

This was one of the reports I conducted about cancer research. This project emphasized the use of 'ggplot2' in R, and required extensive outside research into health effects of Hemoglobin, Albumin or Iron.
