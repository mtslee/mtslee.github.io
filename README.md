My name is Matthew Lee and I want to thank you for taking the time to visit my data science portfolio. Please explore some of the projects I have done during my undergraduate career at the University of California, Davis. 


# About Me
I am currently a senior at the University of California, Davis with a double major in Applied Statistics and Economics. As an avid basketball fan, I grew up fascinated by simple statistics such as Win-Loss record or Strength of Schedule. This interest led me to pursue my major where I could learn more about how people incorporate data into decision making. After graduation, I will be working in San Francisco as a Risk & Compliance Consultant. 

I hope to one day build a career in Data Science and potentially work with the NBA. My specific areas of interest are Predictive Analytics and understanding how travel patterns influence energy and fatique. I am also working with a graduate student here at UC Davis where we are conducting historical firm data. We are studying Merger & Acquisitions over a 30 year time period and analyzing their effects on the market competition using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI). Once completed, I'll post the findings here.

## STA 141B - Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis
[USDA Fresh Foods](141b/assignment4+Matthew+Lee.html) 

This was an assignment for my data science course where I used the USDA API key to get the nutritional information for a list of common fruits and vegetables. It required the use of web scraping to find the nutritional data, and then Pandas was used to convert it all into a digestible dataframe. 

[SF Data Portal](141b/assignment6+Matthew_Lee.html)
I was really excited to work on this project since it was my first exposure to using SQL, which is commonly used in the work force. Also, I hope to move to San Francisco after I have saved up enough money, so it was fascinating to learn more about the city. This also features Mapping, where I plotted the location of park and noise disturbances across the city of San Francisco.

## STA 141A - Fundamentals of Statistical Data Science

[NHANES](141a/141a+hw+2.html) 

This was one of the reports I conducted about cancer research. This project emphasized the use of 'ggplot2' in R, and required extensive outside research into health effects of Hemoglobin, Albumin or Iron. 


## Consult Your Community | UC Davis
I am an Engagement Manager for a non-profit consulting organization here at UC Davis. This is a copy of our final deliverable for our client Smartz Graphics.
