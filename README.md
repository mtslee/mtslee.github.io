## Welcome to my page!

# Hi everyone!
My name is Matthew Lee and I want to thank you for taking the time to visit my data science portfolio. Please explore some of the projects I have done during my undergraduate career at the University of California, Davis. 


# About Me
I am currently a senior at the University of California, Davis with a double major in Applied Statistics and Economics. As an avid basketball fan, I have always been fascinated by numbers and statistics. This interest led me to pursue my major where I could learn more about how people incorporate data into decision making. When I graduate, I will be working as a Consultant for Protiviti in San Francisco.
